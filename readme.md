# speakTypingWords NVDA addon

NVDA reads the entire word when it is modified, instead of just the added part, which is the default behavior.

This code has been extracted from NVDAExtensionGlobalPlugin add-on by Paulber19.

The function that executes this code was removed from the original addon in version 13.3, however, some users missed it.
This fork recovers the function by adapting it to work independently in a small addon for those users.
